				<h1>Hello, I'm Charles Perrier</h1>
				<img src="Images/logo.jpeg" class="img-circle" width="100px" height="100px" alt="Charles">
					<p>
						I am 18 years old and I am currently a first year BBA student at ESSEC business school.
						<br>
Beside that, I also created my own clothes brand, Charly’s, that is part of the ESSEC ventures. The objective of this brand is to counter fast fashion by promoting quality and respect for environment and for workers. But also to counter luxury brands that sell basic t-shirts for hundreds of euros.

				<h2><strong>Fashion & Sneakers</strong></h2>
					<p>Obviously I am passionate about fashion but more specifically about sneakers. I have a collection of sneakers that goes from basic pairs of shoes to rare pairs with a real story. However, I think that every pair of shoes has its own story and that sneakers should be considered as a type of art. I like to share this passion with others, this is why I am the head of the sneakers pole of mod’essec, the fashion association of the school.</strong></p>

				<h2><strong>Travelling</strong></h2>
					<p>Another thing I like to do in life is to travel wether it is with my girlfriend, my family, my friends or alone. I really think that everybody should have the opportunity to discover the world and other cultures. I had the chance to discover a lot of Asian countries with my parents such as Indonesia, Singapore or even Thailand but also to travel alone in Ireland to play golf and practice my English. However, I think that France is one of the most beautiful countries in the world and I don’t think I could leave the country to go live abroad for ever even though I want to work abroad at least a couple years in my life.</strong></p>

				<h2><strong>Sports</strong></h2>
					<p>A third passion I have is sport. It is the most efficient way to relax, spend time with your friends and take care of yourself will having fun and challenging yourself. I don’t think I could live without doing sports at least once in a week. For me it is also and escape from this world during which you can really think freely but it is also a way of challenging yourself and accomplish new objectives. I am a golfer, a boxer, a cyclist but I still want to discover new sports. This is why every year I spend one week with some friends experimenting new sports that we can’t do in Paris such as canyoning in Italy, mountain biking in the alps or even kitesurfing at Le Touquet.</p>
